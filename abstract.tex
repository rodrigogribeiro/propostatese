The introduction of multi-parameter type classes in Haskell has been
hindered because of problems associated to ambiguity, which occur due
to the lack of type specialization during type inference. This work proposes a new
type system for Haskell that supports the definition of multi-parameter
type classes without the need of any extensions like functional dependencies or 
type families and allows the definition of overloaded symbols without the corresponding type class. 
A type inference algorithm sound and complete with respect to the proposed type system is presented and implemented.
